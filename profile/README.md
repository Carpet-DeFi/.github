# Introduction to Carpet DeFi

Carpet DeFi is a value protocol, loosely based on [WAND Investments' number-go-up technology](https://medium.com/coinmonks/wand-investments-whitepaper-reconciling-safety-sustainability-and-rewards-in-defi-ba20d96213). **Your CARPETs will always rise in value** _(unless something ridiculous happens)_

> This is called the Positive Value Invariant! Your CARPET holdings will always grow in value over time, the price at one moment is always greater or equal to any price in any other previous point in time.
